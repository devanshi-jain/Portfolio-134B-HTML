              I am a 3rd-year undergraduate at UC San Diego studying mathematics and computer science. I have 
              a keen interest in probabilistic reasoning in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

            Here is Einstein's famous equation:
              <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                  <mstyle displaystyle="true">
                      <msup>
                          <mi>E</mi>
                      </msup>
                      <mo>=</mo>
                      <msup>
                          <mi>m</mi>
                      </msup>
                      <mo>&#8290;</mo>
                      <msup>
                          <mi>c</mi>
                          <mn>2</mn>
                      </msup>
                  </mstyle>
              </math>
            </p>
            <p>MathML, despite being in the HTML specification for a long time, has only recently gained broader support. In 2008, 
                Firefox started supporting it, and in 2012, Safari followed suit. However, it took even longer for Chrome and Edge to 
                support MathML, which happened not until 2023! The delayed of MathML was was due to various factors, including the non-uniform browser 
                compatibilities being the major factor, along with others like complexities of rendering math notation on the web. This includes the hefty task of 
                that MathML has to support this across different browsers and versions.</p>
